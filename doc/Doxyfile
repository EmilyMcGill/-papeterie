# Doxyfile 1.7.4

# !!! Invoke doxygen from project root using: 
#    doxygen doc/Doxyfile

# This file describes the settings to be used by the documentation system
# doxygen (www.doxygen.org) for a project
#
# All text after a hash (#) is considered a comment and will be ignored
# The format is:
#       TAG = value [value, ...]
# For lists items can also be appended using:
#       TAG += value [value, ...]
# Values that contain spaces should be placed between quotes (" ")

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Project related configuration options
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# This tag specifies the encoding used for all characters in the config file 
# that follow. The default is UTF-8 which is also the encoding used for all 
# text before the first occurrence of this tag. Doxygen uses libiconv (or the 
# iconv built into libc) for the transcoding. See 
# http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv for the list of possible encodings.

DOXYFILE_ENCODING      = UTF-8

# The PROJECT_NAME tag is a single word (or a sequence of words surrounded 
# by quotes) that should identify the project.

PROJECT_NAME           = Bitcoin

# The PROJECT_NUMBER tag can be used to enter a project or revision number. 
# This could be handy for archiving the generated documentation or 
# if some version control system is used.

PROJECT_NUMBER         = 0.5.0

# Using the PROJECT_BRIEF tag one can provide an optional one line description 
# for a project that appears at the top of each page and should give viewer 
# a quick idea about the purpose of the project. Keep the description short.

PROJECT_BRIEF          = "P2P Digital Currency"

# With the PROJECT_LOGO tag one can specify an logo or icon that is 
# included in the documentation. The maximum height of the logo should not 
# exceed 55 pixels and the maximum width should not exceed 200 pixels. 
# Doxygen will copy the logo to the output directory.

PROJECT_LOGO           = doc/bitcoin_logo_doxygen.png

# The OUTPUT_DIRECTORY tag is used to specify the (relative or absolute) 
# base path where the generated documentation will be put. 
# If a relative path is entered, it will be relative to the location 
# where doxygen was started. If left blank the current directory will be used.

OUTPUT_DIRECTORY       = doc/doxygen

# If the CREATE_SUBDIRS tag is set to YES, then doxygen will create 
# 4096 sub-directories (in 2 levels) under the output directory of each output 
# format and will distribute the generated files over these directories. 
# Enabling this option can be useful when feeding doxygen a huge amount of 
# source files, where putting all generated files in the same directory would 
# otherwise cause performance problems for the file system.

CREATE_SUBDIRS         = NO

# The OUTPUT_LANGUAGE tag is used to specify the language in which all 
# documentation generated by doxygen is written. Doxygen will use this 
# information to generate all constant output in the proper language. 
# The default language is English, other supported languages are: 
# Afrikaans, Arabic, Brazilian, Catalan, Chinese, Chinese-Traditional, 
# Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Esperanto, Farsi, Finnish, French, German, 
# Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Japanese-en (Japanese with English 
# messages), Korean, Korean-en, Lithuanian, Norwegian, Macedonian, Persian, 
# Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Serbian-Cyrillic, Slovak, 
# Slovene, Spanish, Swedish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.

OUTPUT_LANGUAGE        = English

# If the BRIEF_MEMBER_DESC tag is set to YES (the default) Doxygen will 
# include brief member descriptions after the members that are listed in 
# the file and class documentation (similar to JavaDoc). 
# Set to NO to disable this.

BRIEF_MEMBER_DESC      = YES

# If the REPEAT_BRIEF tag is set to YES (the default) Doxygen will prepend 
# the brief description of a member or function before the detailed description. 
# Note: if both HIDE_UNDOC_MEMBERS and BRIEF_MEMBER_DESC are set to NO, the 
# brief descriptions will be completely suppressed.

REPEAT_BRIEF           = YES

# This tag implements a quasi-intelligent brief description abbreviator 
# that is used to form the text in various listings. Each string 
# in this list, if found as the leading text of the brief description, will be 
# stripped from the text and the result after processing the whole list, is 
# used as the annotated text. Otherwise, the brief description is used as-is. 
# If left blank, the following values are used ("$name" is automatically 
# replaced with the name of the entity): "The $name class" "The $name widget" 
# "The $name file" "is" "provides" "specifies" "contains" 
# "represents" "a" "an" "the"

# If the ALWAYS_DETAILED_SEC and REPEAT_BRIEF tags are both set to YES then 
# Doxygen will generate a detailed section even if there is only a brief 
# description.

ALWAYS_DETAILED_SEC    = NO

# If the INLINE_INHERITED_MEMB tag is set to YES, doxygen will show all 
# inherited members of a class in the documentation of that class as if those 
# members were ordinary class members. Constructors, destructors and assignment 
# operators of the base classes will not be shown.

INLINE_INHERITED_MEMB  = NO

# If the FULL_PATH_NAMES tag is set to YES then Doxygen will prepend the full 
# path before files name in the file list and in the header files. If set 
# to NO the shortest path that makes the file name unique will be used.

FULL_PATH_NAMES        = YES

# If the FULL_PATH_NAMES tag is set to YES then the STRIP_FROM_PATH tag 
# can be used to strip a user-defined part of the path. Stripping is 
# only done if one of the specified strings matches the left-hand part of 
# the path. The tag can be used to show relative paths in the file list. 
# If left blank the directory from which doxygen is run is used as the 
# path to strip.

STRIP_FROM_PATH        = 

# The STRIP_FROM_INC_PATH tag can be used to strip a user-defined part of 
# the path mentioned in the documentation of a class, which tells 
# the reader which header file to include in order to use a class. 
# If left blank only the name of the header file containing the class 
# definition is used. Otherwise one should specify the include paths that 
# are normally passed to the compiler using the -I flag.

STRIP_FROM_INC_PATH    = 

# If the SHORT_NAMES tag is set to YES, doxygen will generate much shorter 
# (but less readable) file names. This can be useful if your file system 
# doesn't support long names like on DOS, Mac, or CD-ROM.

SHORT_NAMES            = NO

# If the JAVADOC_AUTOBRIEF tag is set to YES then Doxygen 
# will interpret the first line (until the first dot) of a JavaDoc-style 
# comment as the brief description. If set to NO, the JavaDoc 
# comments will behave just like regular Qt-style comments 
# (thus requiring an explicit @brief command for a brief description.)

JAVADOC_AUTOBRIEF      = YES

# If the QT_AUTOBRIEF tag is set to YES then Doxygen will 
# interpret the first line (until the first dot) of a Qt-style 
# comment as the brief description. If set to NO, the comments
